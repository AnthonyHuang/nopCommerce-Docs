*nopCommerce docs style guide*

If you are going to contribute to nopCommerce documentation please follow these simple rules to make the docs consistent and easy to read.

1. Use bold text style to highlight paths, fields, buttons.
	* To configure Avalara tax provider go to **Configuration → Tax providers**
	* Assign appropriate code from drop-down list in **Tax Category** field
	* Click **Configure** beside the Avalara tax provider option in the list
	
2. Write headers, button and field names as it's presented in nopCommerce admin area or public site. Don't use capital letters unnecessarily as well as CAPSLOCK key.
	* If you are reffering to a message template list page write: **Content management -> Message templates** and not **Content Management -> Message Templates**
	* Use **Edit** button but not **EDIT** button
	* Follow correct brand name spelling: **PayPal Smart Payment Buttons**

3. Use the existing quotes style: “correct”.
	* "Incorrect"
	* «Incorrect»
	* 'Incorrect'
	
4. Make articles readable and easy to understand. Use headers, notes, lists, screenshots and other tools to make the article understandable.
	* 	# this is a huge header #
		## this is a smaller header ##
		### this is even smaller ###
	* 	> [!NOTE]
		> 
		> This is a note

5. Optimize screenshots quality to reduce image size.

6. If you have any doubts regarding article styling just see how it's already done on other documentation pages.
